# Chronicle Backend

A real-time collaborative storytelling game backend built with Node.js, Express, TypeScript, MongoDB, and Socket.IO

## üìã Overview

Chronicle is a multiplayer game where players take turns contributing to a story. Each round, players submit text fragments, vote on their favorites, and collectively build a unique narrative. The backend handles game state management, real-time updates, user authentication, and data persistence.

- Real-time Gameplay: Utilizes Socket.IO for instant updates and interactions
- User Authentication: Secure Firebase authentication integration
- Game Management: Create, join, and manage storytelling games
- Voting System: Vote on story fragments to determine the narrative direction
- Persistent Storage: MongoDB integration for saving game states and user data
- RESTful API: Comprehensive API for game and user management

## üõ†Ô∏è Tech Stack

- Node.js: JavaScript runtime
- Express: Web framework
- TypeScript: Type-safe JavaScript
- MongoDB: NoSQL database for data persistence
- Socket.IO: Real-time bidirectional event-based communication
- Firebase Admin: Authentication and user management
- Mongoose: MongoDB object modeling
- Joi: Data validation
